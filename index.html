                                <p>
                                    Hello! My name is Catherine Bregou (she/her) and I am a rising senior computer science major at Carleton College. I am from Hanover, New Hampshire and some of my hobbies include hosting my radio show, playing ultimate frisbee, crocheting, nordic skiing, and watching Modern Family in Spanish (Familia Moderna). This summer I got the opportunity to intern at Microsoft where I worked on cutting-edge mobile device management solutions. Below you can see some of my personal projects. If you want to learn more about me you can contact me at bregouc@carleton.edu or view my resume <a href="images/Catherine Bregou Resume 2024 (1).pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

										<h2>Online Othello Game with AI Opponents</h2>

									</div>
									<p>I collaborated with a team to develop an online version of the game Othello. The game features a secure login system, two levels of AI opponents, and a multi-player mode that allows players to send codes to friends for competitive play. Additionally, players can send emojis during games for interactive communication. A stats page records and displays the outcomes of previous games. A quick demo is available if you click the image above, and for those interested in exploring the codebase further, click <a href="https://github.com/millerr2024/Othello-Project" target="_blank">here</a> to access our repository.</p>

										var thumbnail = document.getElementById('videoThumbnail');
										console.log("Play function triggered"); // Log to confirm function trigger
										thumbnail.style.display = 'none'; // Hide the image
										video.style.display = 'block'; // Show the video
										video.play().then(() => {
											console.log("Video started playing"); // Log to confirm video started playing
										}).catch((error) => {
											console.error("Error playing video:", error); // Log any errors

                                    <p>I developed a Digital Evolution environment to study the intricate relationship between host organisms and parasites. In this environment, blue organisms represent parasites, unable to reproduce independently, while orange organisms represent hosts that can reproduce either with other orange organisms or be exploited by parasites for reproduction. Each organism possesses a unique genome and evolves over time to enhance its efficiency in achieving its objectives, with evolutionary progress indicated by slight color changes. The results of my experiment revealed that the presence of parasites unexpectedly benefits host organisms by increasing competition.</p>

									<p>I led the creation of a data visualization site using Department of Homeland Security data, simplifying global immigration insights. I developed a user-friendly platform with customizable SQL queries, generating intuitive graphs and maps. y emphasis on accessibility ensured WAVE test compliance, achieved through contrast optimization and seamless audio integration, resulting in an inclusive user experience.</p>

										<h2> Chopsticks Game Development Featuring Computer-Driven Gameplay</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/chopsticks.jpg" alt="" class="image fit" />
									<p>I have developed game platforms, including an online game Chopsticks. I designed an intuitive and enjoyable front end interface, allowing players to make moves while the computer strategizes its response. By meticulously calibrating the game's logic, I ensured the computer made thoughtful decisions without being unbeatable, providing a challenging yet rewarding experience for players.</p>

                                    <p>I used Digital Evolution to explore the intricate relationship between host organisms and parasites. Each organism bore a unique genome, evolving over time to enhance efficiency in achieving its objectives. The outcome of my experiment revealed that the presence of parasites unexpectedly benefits reproducer organisms through heightened competition. I expanded this study by modifying variables, allowing me to investigate ecosystem responses across diverse circumstances and extended timeframes.</p>

										<h2> Chopsticks Game Development Featuring Computer-Driven Gameplay</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="images/chopsticks.jpg" alt="" class="image fit" />
									<p>I have developed game platforms, including an online game Chopsticks. I designed an intuitive and enjoyable front end interface, allowing players to make moves while the computer strategizes its response. By meticulously calibrating the game's logic, I ensured the computer made thoughtful decisions without being unbeatable, providing a challenging yet rewarding experience for players.</p>
